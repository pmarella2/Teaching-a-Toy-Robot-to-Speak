# Teaching-a-Toy-Robot-to-Speak
The goal of this project is to teach robots how to learn and speak simple words. We will use the Anki Cozmo robot as a platform. Cozmo has a Python SDK, which can be used to track the robot's internal state. The project will involve finding a way to "link" that internal state of the robot--what it perceives and experiences--to words that are uttered about the environment. For example, if the robot sees a red mug and someone says "that's a red mug" the robot should learn something about what "red" and what "mug" means.
